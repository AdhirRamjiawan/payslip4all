# Specification Quality Checklist: AWS Secrets Scope Refinement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

## Notes

- Validation pass 1 completed successfully.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed.
- The refined scope explicitly excludes DynamoDB runtime and AWS credential groups from the AWS Secrets-backed payload while preserving support for the remaining eligible repo-owned custom app settings.
- The spec keeps the feature constitution-compliant without proposing a constitution change.
